## Testing User Stories

### First Time Visitor Goals  

* As a first time visitor, I want the purpose of the website to be immediately clear and to be enticed by the content of the platform.
    * Upon entering the site, users are greeted with a topical hero image related to the purpose of the website.
    * Upon entering the site, users see a clear tag line that instantly explains what the business offers.

* As a first time visitor, I want to be able to navigate through the site with ease and find what I'm looking for.
    * The header is present across all pages, meaning the user can easily navigate to the page of their choice. The page they're currently on is also highlighted in the navigation bar so they always know where they are.
    * The footer is present across all pages. This contains a contact button that the user can always use to be diverted if they have any questions.
    * Links are clearly outlined using hover effects, so the user knows they are clickable.

* As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily check social media accounts to determine trust.
    * Social links are always present at the bottom of the page.
    * Social links are represented by icons that are easy to see and coherent with the design of the rest of the site.

### Potential Student Goals

* As a potential student, I want to see stories of success/legitimacy to know that this is a trusted organisation.
    * As soon as users land on the home page, they will be able to see the 'What Our Students Say' section instantly, just below the hero image. This reinforces the fact that this company is legitimate and successful.
    * After scrolling down further, users will reach the 'Where Our Students Work' section. This achieves the same effect as the previous section, by showing potential students that others in the past have achieved the same goals as they themselves wish to.
    * Further down on the home page there is the 'Our Tutors' section. This convinces the potential student that the tutors at the organisation can help them achieve their goals.

* As a potential student, I want to be able to compare the courses available.
    * An overview of each course available is present on the home page.
    * The user can easily navigate to the Courses page any time using the navigation bar. This page is dedicated to going into more detail about each course and what it entails.

* As a potential student, I want to be able to quickly and easily contact the business.
    * The contact button in the footer is present across every page on the site.
    * The contact form is also available at the bottom of the sign up page.

### Returning Visitor Goals

* As a returning visitor, I want to be able to quickly compare reviews & stories of success against information I have found from competitors.
    * The user would already be comfortable with the site, and can easily see where the testimonials start on the home page even if they have not been on the site for a while.

* As a returning visitor, who has already contacted the business, I want to be able to easily sign up for the course of my choice.
    * There is a large call to action for users to sign up on the hero image on the page. Users can instantly see this and sign up.
    * The sign up link in the navigation bar is present across all pages for the user to click.

## Further Testing

* The website was checked in the following browsers:
    * Microsoft edge
    * Google Chrome
    * Mozilla Firefox

* All links were tested and direct to the correct places.

* All pages were resized, checked at every breakpoint and media queries were added where necessary to ensure content is completely responsive to different device sizes.

* Friends/family were asked to review the site to point out any existing errors.

## Bugs/Errors

There were some HTML validation issues throughout the development process. For example, some heading elements on certain pages were not in sequentially descending order, there were some link tags nested in button elements, and a few design flaws that I discussed with my mentor.

All known bugs/errors have since been fixed.
