# jCode Online Coding Bootcamp

This is the marketing site for jCode. jCode is an online coding bootcamp, focused on providing completely bespoke courses. This platform is unique in the sense that potential students get in touch to have a course tailored to them and their needs.

The site is designed to be responsive and accesible on all devices, meaning it is easy to navigate for potential students.

## UX

### Purpose

jCode allows students to learn on their terms. Everyone is different, and so are their learning styles. We recognise this, and give learners the chance to create their own journey. 

Two main course structures are offered: an interview/data structures course, and a full-stack web development course. jCode will offer all relevant information for potential students to decide on a course, and prompt them to get in touch with the team to begin their bespoke plan. The site will provide potential students with figures of previous success, in an attempt to convince them to invest in the service.

People live busy lives, and this platform aims to provide all with a chance at learning to program.

### Design

* Colour Scheme
    * The three main colours used across jCode are blue, orange and grey.

* Typography
    * The Fjalla One font is the font used for titles across the website, and Roboto is used for all paragraphs, with Sans-Serif as the fallback for both, in case the font isn't being imported to the site correctly for a user. These are both very clean fonts, with a modern feel, making them appropriate for clearly representing the information across the site. 

* Imagery
    * The imagery across the site is relevant and coherent. Images are large, and eye-catching, but not stretched or pixelated. They are relevant to the meaning the site is trying to convey, providing a clean, modern aesthetic.
